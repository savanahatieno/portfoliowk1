                <h2><span style="color: brown;">About me</span></h2>
                I was born in Nakuru and being the most silent girl in my family i came to be more fun as i grew up.i have a big sister who is my best friend and wont ask for more.
                I am a half cast of two languages and none of them i know much but that is my goal to know atleast half of each .But its fun to know their cultures and actually know where i come from.

                <h2>Why i chose Software development </h2> 
                i decided to challenge myself to do what i literally dont know and might hate it afterwards.i do love coding but the reason was the state at which you love so many different things and you never know know how it will go or you may end up having an error or something.<br>That suspense of trying something that your hoping is the best feeling one can have and it just maeks you to never give up.i also love coding coz am able to create ad design websites or apps.
                <h2>My hobbies/interest/skills</h2>
            </p>
            <p >
            Am the kind of person who will literally try anything just to feel the experience.I can't say the specific of what my hobbies are coz its <strong>ALL OF THEM!</strong>to be honest.But i love listening to music,going on adventures,watching conspiracy videos and some little history,playing video games and just editing videos for fun.<br>
            When it comes to skill am good at anything i can .I am mostly interested in anything that includes creativity and design .
